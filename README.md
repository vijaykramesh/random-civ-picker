# Civilization V Draft Picker

Forked from https://github.com/nocturnaltortoise/random-civ-picker

This lets you pick a draft for Civ5 multi-player, 3 Civs per player (with +2 drafts that are open for any human who gets Venice or Denmark).
You can toggle Civs to disable by clicking "Show Excluded Civs".

Make sure to heed the Khall.

## Todo:
*Add Civ VII
